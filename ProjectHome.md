Simulates the radiative emission from blazars, which are Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) jets that are pointed towards us, i.e., the observer.  Uses models of inverse Compton (IC) scattering and synchrotron radiation to simulate the radiation coming from each "Zone" or computational cell in the jet.

Description of the original Fortran simulation (c. 2013) written by Professor Alan Marscher (BU) is here: http://www.bu.edu/blazars/paperstodownload/temz_apj2014.pdf

`ctemz` has been compiled and executed successfully on Ubuntu and CentOS systems. In particular, it has **not** yet been successfully compiled on OS X.
